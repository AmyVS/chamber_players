#Chamber Players

This is a project I conjured using Ruby and Active Record. It provides these handy tools:

* Keeps a chamber music (i.e. small musical ensemble) library
* Adds musicians to the database
* Searches for chamber music by composer
* Searches for muscians by instrument
* Allows the user to assign a piece's part to a particular musician
* Allows the user to remove these things from the database

Enjoy!

##Installation
Look for the option on the right sidebar that says "HTTPS clone URL". Just click on the little clipboard icon to copy the address. Hop on over to your command line, type "git clone" and paste the copied address. That should give you a copy of all the files.

Just a friendly reminder, you'll want to run $bundle to make sure your gem files are updated. In addition, be sure to run $rake db:create to create the databases and $rake db:migrate to get all the tables set up appropriately - that should do it.
